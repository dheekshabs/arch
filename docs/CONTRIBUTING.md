## How to contribute to Arch

**Did you find a bug?**

* **Do not open up a GitHub issue if the bug is a security vulnerability
  in Arch**, and instead email to nasrulhazim.m@gmail.com.

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/nasrulhazim/arch/issues).

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/nasrulhazim/arch/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

* Use [ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md](ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md) for submitting new issue.

**Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

* Open a new pull request with the patch.

* Use [PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md](PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md) for submitting new pull request.

**Did you fix whitespace, format code, or make a purely cosmetic patch?**

* We use PHP CS Fixer.

**Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?**

* Open an issue on GitHub if you already have collected positive feedback about the change.

Thanks! :heart: :heart: :heart:
